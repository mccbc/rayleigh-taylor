    "### Introduction\n",
    "`git` is an incredibly powerful *version tracker*. When used correctly, it tracks the changes of the files you create and code you write, enabling you to work on independently on multiple versions of the same file with several collaborators.\n",
    "\n",
    "`GitHub` is an online platform for storing your code bases, or *repositories*. Others can *clone* repositories to simply use your code, or they may create *forks* of your repository make their own changes. Forks can also be *merged* with the main branch of the code using a *pull request*, but this is more advanced than we'll need to get for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another benefit of installing `git` is that on Windows it comes with its own terminal. Powershell is good in a pinch, but we'd really prefer to use a proper bash terminal, so this is a great added bonus."

    "### Procedure\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Follow the instructions found here: https://github.com/git-guides/install-git. Download the installer and go through the steps. Be sure the install path is something like `C:\\Program Files\\Git`.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. During installation when you select the components to install, be sure that \"Windows Explorer integration\" is checked. The sub-option \"Git Bash Here\" is especially important. This should be selected by default. None of the options should need to be changed.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The default editor doesn't matter too much since we'll be using Jupyter Notebooks for all our coding. For convenience, you may switch it to \"Use Notepad as Git's default editor\" since Notepad is a simple and intuitive text editor that comes prepackaged with Windows. There are undoubtedly better options to use, but we won't concern ourselves with installing those right now.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Proceed through the installer leaving all remaining options as their default.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "5. At the end, select \"Launch Git Bash\" and press the Finish button. A new terminal window should open that looks slightly different than Powershell.\n",
    "    - You can launch this terminal from any file explorer in Windows by right clicking and selecting \"Git Bash Here\" from the drop-down menu. A bash terminal will open with the current working directory set to the location in the file explorer from which you started it.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Type `git` into the terminal and press enter. You should see some commands with descriptions of what they do. We'll save those for later --- for now, this is just checking to make sure everything installed properly!"

    "    - **Tip**: In this guide, any time you see ``text like this``, you should type it into the terminal and press <kbd>Enter</kbd>. If you see something surrounded by brackets ``like [this]``, you should replace ``[this]`` with something else. Don't type the brackets into the terminal.\n",
    "    - It is common practice in coding tutorials to represent the command line with a ``$`` for `bash` (the terminal language) or a ``>`` symbol for Python. If you see a line of code with either those symbols in front, it just indicates that you should type what follows into the appropriate command line, without typing the symbol itself.\n",
